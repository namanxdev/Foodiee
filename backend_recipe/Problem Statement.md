# Problem Statements

Every users have difficulty in choosing the meal the like that can be made from the ingredients they have but since people live in different regions and prefer different taste like spicy,sweet,sour,etc also two people might have same ingredients but might prefer different breakfast
like example of indian and american diets and if people also have different time available to make food like less time for breakfast and 
more time for dinner also people are allergic and dislike some ingredients 


# Possible solution

### Now only mvp is need in jupyter notebook
Since people cannot get that accurate results from ai by putting prompts like "recommend me food" we need an program that uses langchain and python to take information from user and recomend them recipes according to there preferrences and ask questions to get accurate meals for user that makes them satisfied  and also uses RAG with give reciepe books and and gives users step by step recipe so user doesn't get over whelmed like if users asks for image for that particular step it generates using gemini api key and also like there are some ingredients user might not have reciepe but are needed in reciepe so it asks them and if not available then gives them alternatives
